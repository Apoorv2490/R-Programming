data(Groceries)
str(Groceries) ## NOTE: The data has to be in transaction form

### In case the data is not in transaction form use this command to convert it to transaction form

Groceries <- as(Groceries, "transactions") 

## Generate association rules
rules <- apriori(Groceries, parameter=list(supp=0.001, conf=0.08)) 

### To look at rules
inspect(rules) 

### Here a data frame of rules along with their associations is created

ruleList <- data.frame(lhs = labels(lhs(rules)) , rhs = labels(rhs(rules)), rules@quality)
